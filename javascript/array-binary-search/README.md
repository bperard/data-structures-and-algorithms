# Binary Search of Sorted Array

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

Our approach was to talk about why searching through a sorted array is hard for a computer, and then how you may make that easier with a binary search by cutting each step of the search into two smaller groups. After that, we wrote the pseudocode for our algorithm. We didn't get to Big O and the code, but time is O(logn) and I believe space is O(n).
